# From Scratch NN Class convereted from Python 2.7 Code
Numpy only backprop neural net with sigmoidal, linear, gaussian and tanh activation functions.

Originally written in python 2.7 at some point (2012?) then updated to python 3 in 2015 adding the demo function animating the training epochs.

Updated this time to fix animations for current version on python and add to github.


Demo involves a 3 layer NN learning the ammonia saturation curve...which was written while I was working in several ammonia plants.
